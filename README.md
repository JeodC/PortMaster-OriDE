# PortMaster Wine - Ori and the Blind Forest
This isn't really a port, it's Ori and the Blind Forest running on wine64 and box64. It will boot and play on the Retroid Pocket 5 and Retroid Pocket Mini with a Rocknix distribution that has box64 and wine64 bundled. Such distributions (dev builds) can be found on the Rocknix Discord server.

## Installation
Copy the `ori` folder and `Ori and the Blind Forest.sh` file to the same place you would normally place your port files e.g. `/roms/ports`. This port uses the Steam version with Wine64. Purchase and install the game with Steam on Windows (or download the Windows depot) and copy all of its data to `ori/data`. You can use the Definitive Edition data or the original game data. The launchscript should detect which version you're using and launch accordingly.

If you want to set up the emulationstation decorations, copy `cover.png` to the `ori` folder and copy the contents of `gameinfo.xml` to your `gamelist.xml` file.
